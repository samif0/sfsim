# sfsim

A library for my future simulations.

--- 
# Milestones

Tracking certain milestones that get me closer to a good enough simuluation library.

## M1. Create rotating 3D cube with triangles. (DONE)
8 verticies with 2 triangles per face. These triangles are drawn via perspective projection with field of view.

#### Learned
- Using matricies to transform a point in space to another point in space.
- Efficient way to draw lines using Brasenham line algorithm.
- Getting lldb debugger to run in VScode with a CMake/VCPKG C++ project (rest my soul...)

## M2. Create a 3D grid
## M3. Create some simple 3D objects (Spheres, Cones, Prisms)
## M4. Figure out how to make 3D objects interact and collide
## M5. Create a simple simulation of objects interacting in a 3D grid
## M6. Enact graviy in a simulation and visualize the change in the 3D grid.
## M7. Create a simple simulation of objects orbiting each other
## M8. Create a simple fluid simulation
## M9. Create a living system simulation where objects are "living" agents.

All I could think of as of now that would give me confidence that this library is good enough.
