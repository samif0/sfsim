# Milestones

Tracking certain milestones that get me closer to a good enough simuluation library.

## Create rotating 3D cube with triangles.
8 verticies with 2 triangles per face. These triangles are drawn via perspective projection with field of view.

### Learned
- Using matricies to transform a point in space to another point in space.
- Efficient way to draw lines using Brasenham line algorithm.
- Getting lldb debugger to run in VScode with a CMake/VCPKG C++ project (rest my soul...)
